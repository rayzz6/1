If this function is running, you could find the path of cascade_failure_simulator_based_on_Motter_Lai_model.json in Global_Data.json.","interdependent_critical_infrastructures_networks.json, failure_node_after_HECRAS_simulations.json",Simulate cascade failure based on Motter Lai model,cascade_failure_simulator_based_on_Motter_Lai_model.json
